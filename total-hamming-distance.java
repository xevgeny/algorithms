For all number a1, a2, a3,..., a(n), if there are p numbers have 0 as LSB (put in set M), 
and q numbers have 1 for LSB (put in set N).

There are 2 situations:
Situation 1. If the 2 number in a pair both comes from M (or N), the total will get 0.
Situation 2. If the 1 number in a pair comes from M, the other comes from N, the total will get 1.
Since Situation 1 will add NOTHING to the total, we only need to think about Situation 2
How many pairs are there in Situation 2?
We choose 1 number from M (p possibilities), and 1 number from N (q possibilities).
The total possibilities is p Ã— q = pq, which means
The total Hamming distance will get pq from LSB.
